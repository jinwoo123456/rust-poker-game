# The library name keeps ABI stable usage from main.rs (tauri_app_lib). We can keep as-is to avoid refactors.
[lib]
# The `_lib` suffix may seem redundant but it is necessary
# to make the lib name unique and wouldn't conflict with the bin name.
# This seems to be only an issue on Windows, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8519
# NOTE: Keeping lib name as tauri_app_lib to match src-tauri/src/main.rs use.
